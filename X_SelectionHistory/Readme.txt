Open the tool trough Window -> General -> Selection History. You can then dock it where ever you like

# Usage
Once the window is open, any selection changes are recorded and listed. Clicking an item in the list will select the object, but it won't be added to the list again.

Selection can be navigated using the bracket[] keys, though this only works if the Scene view has focus.

Clicking the gear icon will expand the settings menu, here you can toggle the recording of scene hierarchy objects and project window assets.
